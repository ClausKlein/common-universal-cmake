common-universal-cmake
======================

Some CMake macros which are common to all polysquare projects. Not necessarily designed to be portable, though the underlying modules which do the grunt work are.

This is the testing branch of common-universal-cmake and contains a sample project and some automated tests to run. It is designed to be merged
into the mainline branch as part of a travis-ci job.
